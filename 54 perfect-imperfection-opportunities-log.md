# Perfect Imperfection Opportunities Log — "Fractured Code"

**Purpose:**  
Track scenes/passages that would benefit from ambiguity, contradiction, or unresolved tension. Suggest where to "leave rough edges" or resist the urge to over-resolve for maximal human literary value.

## 1. Imperfection Log Table

| Chapter/Scene | Current State | Opportunity for Ambiguity/Contradiction | Suggestion for Leaving Rough Edge | Literary Rationale/Comp Reference |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|               |              |                                         |                                   |                                   |

## 2. Imperfection Checklist

- [ ] Unanswered questions or open-ended exchanges
- [ ] Contradictory motivations or feelings left unresolved
- [ ] Subtle inconsistencies in perception, memory, or world logic (when plausible)
- [ ] Scenes that could end on a question or image, not an answer

## 3. Editorial Philosophy

- Reference how Watts or Leckie use ambiguity to deepen immersion, not confuse.
- Aim for "unfinished" moments that invite reader participation, not lazy vagueness.
- Trust that a little mess creates resonance beyond tidy closure.

**Editorial Note:**  
Flag any passage where “over-polishing” would reduce emotional or philosophical impact.
