# Human Rhythm & Pacing Map — "Fractured Code"

**Purpose:**  
Annotate manuscript for pacing that feels algorithmic, relentless, or monotonous versus sections with organic, varied, and surprising rhythm. Guide final revision toward more breathing space, narrative unpredictability, and human cadence.

## 1. Pacing Annotation Table

| Chapter/Scene | Section/Line | Rhythm/Pacing Issue (e.g., too regular, breathless, static) | Opportunity for Human Rhythm | Specific Revision/Break Suggestion |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
|               |              |                                                            |                              |                                    |

## 2. Human Pacing Prompts

- [ ] Does the scene allow for pause, breath, or reflection?
- [ ] Are breaks in action/dialogue organic or formulaic?
- [ ] Is there variation in sentence/paragraph length and structure?
- [ ] Are slow/fast sections earned by context, or just structural default?
- [ ] Does the chapter/scene end on a beat that lingers, rather than wrapping too neatly?

## 3. Editorial Strategy

- Reference how Watts/Leckie/Rajaniemi use slow build, abrupt cut, or extended silence to control reader attention.
- Suggest where to insert "dead air," stillness, or abrupt shifts for dramatic effect.
- Flag scenes that feel "serialized," "machine-paced," or too even.

**Note:**  
Strive for an overall rhythm that feels alive—alternating rush, pause, stumble, and surge—mirroring the emotional and thematic journey.
