# Organic Dialogue & Character Voice File — "Fractured Code"

**Purpose:**  
Systematically flag dialogue that reads as generic, expository, or AI-generated. Offer a guide for revision toward more organic, messy, and character-distinct exchanges, always rooted in series canon and world logic.

## 1. Dialogue Audit Table

| Chapter/Scene | Line/Snippet | Problem (e.g., Exposition, Flatness) | Canonical Voice Opportunity | Revision Suggestion (with Character/World Notes) |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
|               |             |                                      |                            |                                                   |

## 2. Character Voice Reference Prompts

- What unique speech rhythm, slang, or diction does this character use?
- Would this character withhold, lie, joke, or deflect in this moment?
- Are power dynamics, class, or neural state affecting their speech?
- Where can dialogue be less "on the nose," more interrupted, or contradictory?

## 3. Dialogue "Messiness" Checklist

- [ ] Fragments, interruptions, overlaps
- [ ] Unanswered questions, trailing off, abrupt shifts
- [ ] Subtext/implication instead of direct statement
- [ ] Speech colored by stress, fatigue, or neural feedback
- [ ] In-world idioms or invented slang (where appropriate)

**Editorial Note:**  
Where possible, cite canonical moments (e.g., Kora’s street patter vs. Mileo’s clinical precision) as models. Encourage letting dialogue “breathe” with pauses or unfinished thoughts.
