# Emotional Microbeats & Vulnerability Map — "Fractured Code"

**Purpose:**  
Map where emotional responses are "just right" and where they feel muted, generic, or overly processed. Provide guidance for allowing more rawness, contradiction, or authentic uncertainty—privileging vulnerability over control.

## 1. Emotional Beat Log

| Chapter/Scene | Moment/Line | Current Response | Issue (Muted, Generic, Over-processed) | Vulnerability/Rawness Opportunity | Specific Revision Prompt |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|
|               |             |                 |                                        |                                   |                         |

## 2. Microbeat Checklist

- [ ] Physical markers of emotion (breath, pulse, tremor, sweating, microexpressions)
- [ ] Contradictory feelings (fear/lust, hope/resignation, defiance/terror)
- [ ] Moments of breakdown, impulsiveness, or confession
- [ ] Unfiltered thought, regret, or shame
- [ ] Emotional "overload" or misfire (e.g., laughter in grief, rage at relief)

## 3. Editorial Notes

- Encourage "letting the mask slip"—especially for command/control characters.
- Allow for silence, avoidance, or self-interruption rather than neat closure.
- Reference emotional ambiguity in works like *Blindsight* (Siri's alienation) or *Ancillary Justice* (Breq’s fractured longing).

**Reminder:**  
Not every moment needs rawness, but key scenes should risk emotional mess—not just processed resilience.
