# Voice & Texture Audit Template â€” "Fractured Code"

**Purpose:**  
Track and annotate passages where prose becomes over-polished, sterile, or AI-generic. Support reinjection of human literary fingerprints: idiosyncratic phrasing, organic rhythm, and emotional undertones unique to living authorship.

## 1. Audit Table

| Chapter/Scene | Line/Section | "Too Clean"/AI-Sounding Example | Opportunity for Human Texture | Suggested Direction |
|---------------|--------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
|               |              |                                  |                              |                     |

## 2. Human Literary Fingerprints Checklist

- [ ] Unexpected, vivid metaphors/analogies
- [ ] Rhythmical sentence variation (short/long, abrupt/rambling)
- [ ] Subtle, lived-in idioms or world-specific slang
- [ ] Moments of ambiguity, contradiction, or emotional "slippage"
- [ ] Slang, broken syntax, or nonstandard punctuation (where voice-appropriate)
- [ ] Character/authorial digressions, asides, or tangents
- [ ] Sensory "overload" or "imperfect" description (not everything perfectly observed)

## 3. Editorial Notes

**Instructions:**  
For each flagged passage, recommend ways to reintroduce grit, voice, or emotional color. Reference comp-authors (e.g., Watts' raw clinical tone, Leckie's AI detachment/ambiguity, Rajaniemi's elliptical phrasing) where helpful.

**Reminder:**  
Aim not to "dirty up" for its own sake, but to bring out the unique human presence behind the text, even (especially) at the expense of algorithmic neatness.
