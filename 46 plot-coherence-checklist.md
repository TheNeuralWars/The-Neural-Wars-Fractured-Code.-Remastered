# Plot Coherence & Integrity Checklist â€” "Fractured Code"

## Purpose
A high-level, actionable list to ensure every chapter and the overall narrative remain logical, compelling, and canon-consistent.

---

### 1. Causal Logic
- Every major event has a clear cause and effect.
- No unexplained reversals or unexplained character actions.

### 2. Escalation & Stakes
- Stakes rise in each section (personal, societal, existential).
- Resistance, sacrifice, and evolutionary threat are always present.

### 3. Canon/World Adherence
- All technological and political developments must align with Series Bible.
- No anachronisms or "magic solutions" outside established Cascade/Link/Architect frameworks.

### 4. Timeline Consistency
- Events and flashbacks fit the historical timeline (Series Bible, Timeline Reference).
- No contradictory timing or character ages.

### 5. Plot Hole & Contrivance Audit
- No "plot armor" or unearned escapes.
- All key reveals are appropriately foreshadowed.

### 6. Pacing & Structure
- No major lulls; each scene advances plot or character.
- Transitions between action, reflection, and cosmic viewpoint are clear and purposeful.
