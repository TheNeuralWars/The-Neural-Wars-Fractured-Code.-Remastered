# Literary Style Benchmark — "Fractured Code"

## Purpose
Establishes the gold standard for prose, rhythm, diction, and sensory detail in "Fractured Code," drawing on reference texts, series canon, and market comps.

---

### 1. Diction & Rhythm
- Language is precise, never generic; every word earns its place.
- Rhythm alternates between immersive sensory action and contemplative, cosmic reflection (see Series Style Guide).
- Sentence length is varied for pacing and impact; frequent use of triplet structures for thematic resonance.

### 2. Imagery & Description
- Sensory immersion is mandatory (sight, sound, taste, touch, internal states, neural sensations).
- Imagery is original, never cliché; metaphors are grounded in world physics (e.g., neural feedback, quantum resonance).
- Setting details reinforce mood, theme, and technological context.

### 3. Dialogue & Internal Monologue
- Dialogue uses em-dash convention (see Style Guide).
- Each character's voice is distinct and consistent, reflecting background and current neural state.
- Internal monologue leverages italics, conveys authentic thought, never "AI-generic."

### 4. Prohibited Flaws
- No passive, vague, or filler phrasing.
- No stock "AI" or template sentences.
- No ungrounded exposition dumps; all background info must be contextual and sensory-anchored.

### 5. Canon & Style Adherence
- Scene/POV tags used as per Style Guide.
- All neural/technological experiences described with physical, emotional, and perceptual consequences.
- Consistency with Series Bible terminology and world logic is non-negotiable.
