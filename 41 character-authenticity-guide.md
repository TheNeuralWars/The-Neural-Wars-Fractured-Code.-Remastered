# Character Authenticity & Development Guide â€” "Fractured Code"

## Purpose
Ensures all major and secondary characters maintain authentic, evolving voices, actions, and emotional arcs.

---

### 1. Voice Consistency
- Dialogue and thought patterns fit background and neural state.
- No "author voice" intrudes in character dialogue.

### 2. Emotional Authenticity
- Reactions are grounded in character history and world context (see Series Bible).
- Emotional responses to neural/technological events are physically and psychologically plausible.

### 3. Arc & Agency
- Each major character arcs across the book (change, growth, or tragic stasis).
- Agency is preserved; characters drive plot, not just react.

### 4. Distinctiveness
- No two main POVs sound alike (see comps: "Ancillary Justice," "Nexus").
- Secondary characters have unique mannerisms, speech, and neural "tells."

### 5. Canon Consistency
- All abilities, limitations, and background details match the Series Bible.
- No sudden power-ups, retcons, or out-of-character actions.
