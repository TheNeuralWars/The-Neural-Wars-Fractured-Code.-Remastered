# Sensory Immersion & Embodied Detail Tracker â€” "Fractured Code"

**Purpose:**  
Identify and log scenes where sensory, neural, or physical detail is thin or abstract. Provide actionable recommendations for grounding experience in body, senses, and world-specific physicality.

## 1. Scene/Chapter Table

| Chapter/Scene | Area/Line | Abstract/Thin Example | Missed Sensory/Physical Opportunity | Specific Embodied Detail Suggestions |
|---------------|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
|               |           |                      |                                     |                                      |

## 2. Sensory Modes Checklist

- [ ] Sight (but not just visual)
- [ ] Sound/noise (world-specific tech or environmental cues)
- [ ] Smell (urban, organic, chemical, neural)
- [ ] Taste (rare but powerful when used)
- [ ] Touch (temperature, texture, vibration, neural sensations)
- [ ] Internal (pulse, breath, muscle tension, neural/chemical feedback)

## 3. World-Specific Embodiment Prompts

- Neural/quantum side effects (tingling, pressure, synesthesia, distortion)
- Tech/hardware impacts (interface heat, residue, scars)
- Environmental consequences (humidity, city decay, Cascade anomalies)
- Social/psychological embodiment (posture, microexpressions, tics)

**Goal:**  
Every major beat should anchor the reader in a felt, physical, and world-specific reality, even during abstract or cosmic scenes.
