# Thematic Subtlety & Reader Trust Planner — "Fractured Code"

**Purpose:**  
Identify places where themes are stated too explicitly or "spelled out." Plan revisions to imply, suggest, or layer meaning—trusting the reader’s intelligence and interpretive powers.

## 1. Subtlety Audit Table

| Chapter/Scene | On-the-Nose Theme Statement | Opportunity for Subtext/Implication | Revision/Trust Recommendation | Comp Example (if relevant) |
|---------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
|               |                            |                                     |                              |                            |

## 2. Subtlety Checklist

- [ ] Theme stated in dialogue/monologue vs. shown in action/symbol
- [ ] Repetition of core ideas that could be left for inference
- [ ] Explanatory narration that could be replaced with image or scene
- [ ] Potential for echo/motif rather than explicit restatement

## 3. Editorial Principle

- Trust the reader—especially in a genre aiming for the Watts/Leckie market.
- Replace "telling" with layered images, dialogue, or unresolved situations.
- Reference *Ancillary Justice* for how political/identity themes emerge through structure and voice, not lecture.

**Goal:**  
Enhance depth and re-read value by leaving meaning latent, inviting reader discovery.
